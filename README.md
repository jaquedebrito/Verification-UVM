# Verification – Advanced Digital Systems Course

## 📘 Course Overview

**Verification** is an advanced course focused on verifying digital hardware designs using professional methodologies and tools. The course emphasizes a structured and scalable verification process, highlighting industry standards such as **SystemVerilog** and the **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)**.

## 🎯 Course Objectives

- Master functional verification of complex digital systems.
- Understand and apply the UVM architecture and testbench components.
- Build reusable, scalable, and maintainable verification environments.
- Develop critical thinking for debugging and coverage analysis.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Structured Verification Process
- SystemVerilog Testbenches
- Randomization Techniques
- Functional Coverage
- UVM Testbench Architecture
- Agents, Drivers, Monitors, Scoreboards
- Analysis FIFOs and Reference Models
- Dual Agent Systems and DUT Integration
- Coverage-Driven Verification
- Advanced Debugging and Simulation Tools

## 🧰 UVM Methodology

UVM is used to provide a **common language and structure** across verification projects. It enables:

- **Known structures**: predictable architecture
- **Reusable components**: standard interfaces, agents, drivers
- **Scalability**: independently built and integrated modules
- **Productivity**: easier understanding and maintainability

UVM is the convergence of efforts from Cadence, Mentor, and Synopsys to unify verification methodologies.

## 🔧 UVM Testbench Structure

The course includes the development of a complete UVM testbench, with components such as:

- `uvm_test`, `uvm_env`, `uvm_agent`, `uvm_sequence`, `uvm_driver`, `uvm_monitor`
- `uvm_scoreboard`, `uvm_analysis_fifo`, reference models, and comparators
- Interface-based DUT connection
- Transaction-level modeling
- Functional coverage analysis

## 🧪 Methodological Approach

- **Plan – Develop – Execute – Analyze**
- Emphasis on **coverage, reusability**, and **randomized testing**
- Encouragement of **modular design and verification**
